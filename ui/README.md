# UI

This will be where we put the UI to view trust-assembly content, as well as the browser-extension that transforms users' media feed.

## Vision

As someone browses the web, the headline is replaced with a better version as
determined by the Trust Assembly back-end.

## Project Structure

* `browser-extension/`: Contains the (for now just Chrome) browser extension for transforming headlines.
